## AI API Costs (Critical for PlateCheck)

Since your app will analyze meal photos, this is your biggest variable cost:

### GPT-4o Vision (Recommended)

**Image Processing Costs:**
- Low-detail images: **$0.0002 per image** (~85 tokens)
- High-detail images: **$0.002-$0.003 per image** (765-1,105 tokens)
- Plus text output: $10 per 1M output tokens

**Realistic Cost Per Meal Analysis:**
- Image processing: $0.002
- Prompt + response (~500 tokens): $0.006
- **Total: ~$0.008 per meal logged**

---

## Cost Projection at Scale

### Scenario 1: 1,000 Active Users
- Average 3 meals/day × 30 days = 90,000 meals/month
- Edge function calls: ~180,000 (well under free tier)
- AI costs: 90,000 × $0.008 = **$720/month**
- **Total: $720/month**

### Scenario 2: 10,000 Active Users
- 900,000 meals/month
- Edge functions: 1.8M calls = Free tier on Pro plan
- AI costs: 900,000 × $0.008 = **$7,200/month**
- **Total: $7,225/month (Pro + AI)**

### Scenario 3: 50,000 Active Users
- 4.5M meals/month
- Edge functions: 9M calls = $14 overage (5 packages × $2)
- AI costs: 4.5M × $0.008 = **$36,000/month**
- **Total: $36,039/month**

## Recommended Pricing Strategy

**Philosophy:** Keep it simple. Single tier like successful apps (Bevel, Things 3, Bear).

### Why Single-Tier Pricing Works

Successful apps that use single-tier pricing:

| App | Category | Pricing | Why It Works |
|-----|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Bevel** | Health/Wellness | $4.99/mo or $39/year | Simple value prop, no confusion |
| **Things 3** | Productivity | $49.99 one-time | Premium positioning, one choice |
| **Bear** | Note-taking | $2.99/mo or $29.99/year | Clear free vs. pro split |
| **Carrot Weather** | Weather | $4.99/mo | Features, not limits |
| **Halide** | Photography | $49.99/year | Professional tool, one tier |

**Key Pattern:** Users want simplicity, not choice anxiety. Multiple tiers work for B2B SaaS, not consumer apps.
